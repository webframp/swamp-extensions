## 2026.10.14.1

**Fixed:** Methods that write a singleton resource failed on current swamp with
`Data name 'latest' is reserved for internal use`.

**Changed:** Singleton get and action methods now write their data under
`on_demand_concurrency_cap-current`, `search_suites-current` instead of
`latest`. Anything that read `data.latest("<model>", "latest")` or queried
`name == "latest"` must use the new name.

**Upgrade note:** Data previously stored under `latest` is not migrated; re-run
the method to populate the new name. No attribute schemas changed.
